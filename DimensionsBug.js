This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The values returned by `Dimensions.get('window')` might not accurately reflect the actual screen size, particularly when the app is running in a specific configuration or orientation. This can lead to layout issues and incorrect rendering.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
```
